<h1>scikit_learn_ml</h1>
<p>This project is built to do multiple linear regression models with Scikit-learn in Python. The training data is spread evenly in the graph with z-score normalization. Then gradient descent is conducted to find the values of w and b (parameters). It can predict target values and can also visualize the overall accuracy of the model using matplotlib.</p>
<h3>This project is built using the following tools:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Frameworks & Modules: Scikit-learn, Numpy, Mathplotlib</li>
  <li>Backend: Python 3</li>
</ol>
